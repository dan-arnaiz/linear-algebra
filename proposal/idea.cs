Project Title: Barangay Management System

Project Concept: The Barangay Management System is a software application designed to assist Barangay officials in managing residents, officials, and community events or projects. The system will provide a centralized platform for storing, accessing, and managing all Barangay-related data.

Functionalities:

Residents Module: Add, update, and search for residents. Track family relationships between residents.
Officials Module: Add, update, and track term of office for Barangay officials.
Events/Projects Module: Track and manage events or projects within the Barangay.
Reports Module: Generate various reports based on the data in the system.
Technologies:

Programming Language: C#
Database: SQL Server for data storage and management
Front-End: ASP.NET for creating the user interface
Class Structure:

Resident Class: Contains properties such as Name, Contact Information, Family Members, etc.
Official Class: Contains properties such as Name, Contact Information, Position, Term, etc.
Event/Project Class: Contains properties such as Name, Date, Description, Officials in Charge, Residents Involved, etc.
Report Class: Contains methods for generating various reports.
Class Relationships:

The Official class could have a one-to-many relationship with the Event/Project class, as one official could be in charge of multiple events/projects.
The Resident class could have a many-to-many relationship with the Event/Project class, as one resident could be involved in multiple events/projects and one event/project could involve multiple residents.
External Libraries: No external libraries are planned to be used at this moment. However, this might change as the project progresses and specific needs are identified.

This is a high-level overview of the project. The actual implementation might require additional classes or modifications to the existing ones. The database schema would also need to be designed based on the class structure and relationships.
